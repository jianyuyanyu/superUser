BUILDING FROM SOURCE
********************


VISUAL STUDIO
=============

The "msvc" directory contains what is needed to build the project. Read the file "msvc/README.txt", which explains how.

You will need to download the library files from Microsoft as indicated.



CYGWIN
======

Run the Cygwin installer, available from https://www.cygwin.com/setup-x86.exe.
When you get to the package selection page, select "Category" in the list "View" at the top left, and expand the tree by clicking on "All" and "Devel".

Then choose the following packages (you can use the search box to reduce the list), by selecting the version to install in the column "New":

	- make
	- mingw64-i686-binutils
	- mingw64-i686-gcc-core
	- mingw64-x86_64-binutils
	- mingw64-x86_64-gcc-core

Open a Cygwin terminal and run the following commands:

	cd /cygdrive/c/Dev/superUser 	# (or wherever you put the source to)
	make

If successful, the files "superUser32.exe" and "superUser64.exe" are created.



MSYS2
=====

If you prefer to use the MSYS2 platform, run the installer following the instructions: https://www.msys2.org/

When done, close the "MSYS2 UCRT64" terminal. DO NOT install anything in the UCRT64 environment.


You will need to install the following packages in the following environments.

Open a "MSYS2 MSYS" terminal and run:

	pacman -S make
	pacman -S pactoys
	exit

Open a "MSYS2 MINGW64" terminal and run:

	pacboy -S gcc


To build the 64-bit executable, in the "MSYS2 MINGW64" terminal already open, run:

	cd /c/Dev/superUser 	# (or wherever you put the source to)
	make

If successful, the file "superUser64.exe" is created.


To build the 32-bit executable, open the "MSYS2 MINGW32" terminal and run:

	cd /c/Dev/superUser 	# (or wherever you put the source to)
	make

If successful, the file "superUser32.exe" is created.
